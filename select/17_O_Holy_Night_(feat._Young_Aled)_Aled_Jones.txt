O holy night
The stars are brightly shin-ing
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pin-ing
Till He appeared and the Soul fe-elt its worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoiceth
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Faaalll on your kneeeessss
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh ni-ight divine, Oh-oh night Christ was born
Oh night (Oh night) divine, Oh night, oh ni-ight divine!

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoiceth
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Faaalll on your kneeeessss
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh ni-ight divine, Oh-oh night when Chri-ist was born
Oh night (Oh night) divine, Oh night, oh night di-ivine!

(Oh ni-ight divine)
