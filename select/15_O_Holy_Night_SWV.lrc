[00:01.32] O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
[00:08.61] It is the night of our Savior's birth
[00:15.86] Long lay the world in sin and error pining
[00:26.86] Until He appeared and the soul felt its worth
[00:49.36] 
[00:34.75] A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
[00:44.11] For yonder breaks a new and glorous morn
[00:52.27] Fall on your knees, O hear the angel's voices
[01:06.92] O night divine, O night when Christ was born
[01:23.29] O night divine, O night divine, O night divine
