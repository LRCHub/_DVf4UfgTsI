Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear
Savior's birth!
Long lay the world
in sin and error pining
Until He appeared
and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
a new and glorious morn!
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night Oh night divine
Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of
the dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin
and error pining
Until He appeared
and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new
and glorious morn!
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night, divine
Oh night, Oh night divine
